# Random Image Downloader
***Have you ever needed some sample images?***

You are in the right place!

I created this script for those who need sample images and don't want to download them manually.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

It uses wget to download the files, and normally in windows that file is not in PATH so you need to execute my script in the same folder as wget.exe in order for it to work.
I chose not to add wget.exe to PATH or to the system32 folder because some users don't want leftover files on the computer after using the scripts.
